Heyy, I upload some of my personal projects here, however big or small they may be, once I think they're somewhat ready ^-^

I believe in [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) and publish *all* of my code under the GPL v3.0, which means you can copy and use it however u want, as long as you publish it under the same license!

Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions~
